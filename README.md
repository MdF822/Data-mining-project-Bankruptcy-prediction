This project is a machine learning model developed for bankruptcy prediction using financial data. It is part of a Data Mining course project, focusing on pre-processing, clustering, classification, and evaluation of bank bankruptcy prediction models. The project includes steps such as data cleaning, feature selection, transformation, and clustering to identify patterns in the data. Afterward, various classification algorithms are applied to predict whether a bank will go bankrupt based on its financial indicators, utilizing both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques.
